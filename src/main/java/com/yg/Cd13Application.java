// You are the delta in what you do, not the things you did in the past

// I believe in you. You can do the thing!

// I come from the loving space of my heart, and I know that love opens all doors.

// Deep at the center of my being is an infinite well of love.

// I come from the loving space of my heart, and I know that love opens all doors.

// It’s only a thought, and a thought can be changed.

// You're good enough, you're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you.

// I come from the loving space of my heart, and I know that love opens all doors.

// I believe in you. You can do the thing!

// As I say yes to life, life says yes to me.

// It’s only a thought, and a thought can be changed.
